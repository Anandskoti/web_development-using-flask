    <p1><b>Crop prediction using Machine Learning</b></p1><br>&emsp;
    <p2><b>Description:</b> Crop prediction using the Random Forest algorithm involves analyzing 
    historical and environmental data to forecast yields. This ensemble method improves accuracy by c  
    ombining multiple decision trees. It handles diverse, large datasets and complex interactions, aiding 
   informed agricultural decisions, though it requires significant data and computational resources</p2><br>
